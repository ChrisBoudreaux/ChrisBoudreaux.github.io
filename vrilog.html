                    I've been interested in computer hardware for many years, but before I started college, I was often frustrated
                    by the fact that in order to be a hardware hobbyist, you needed money for components. While a Virtual Reality
                    headset isn't cheap, I felt that this new platform could be used for a wide array of educational purposes.
                    Instead of having many types of labs with fragile specialized equipment, schools of the future may be able to
                    consolidate costs and invest in VR labs.
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    Personally, I can't think of a better way to create interest in computer hardware and logic among students than
                    to put the student directly inside the inner workings of a computer.

                    Ultimately, I to make it possible to simulate all physically possibly circuits in VRilog (within resource constraints).
                    As the name implies, I want to eventually make it possible to extend the simulator with custom modules defined with a Verilog-like syntax.
                    Another main goal of the project is to experiment with intuitive virtual reality interfaces using a minimum number of physical input buttons.
